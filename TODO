the new fn's mpn_lshift1 and mpn_rshift1 have maybe broken the ./configure
--enable-cxx && make , with a bad tag . GMP itself is free from this problem
, so it's a mpir specific problem , probably the same as the previous tag
fix?? or is this the previous bug

the new fns are only visible internally , to get them visible to the user we
need to put the stuff thats in gmp-impl.h into gmp-h.in and get it to work ,
need to bugger about with configure.in etc 

should the test program t-lorrshift1.c exist ? or should we put it in
devel/try ? 

where should we put the test functions for the new functions addadd etc 

should addsub return int or limb ?
