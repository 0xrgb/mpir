fake cpuid to test all paths

new function mpn_divexact_byBm1of   generic and x86_64 versions done
not yet added to fat, can speed up if dont need exact mathematical propoerty
not yet done testing

temporary copy x86_64-defs.m4 in mpn/x86_64 so I can still use .asm files

copy core2/*.asm k10/*.asm to nehalem for a quick boost for that chip

new function divrem_hensel_1 asm and c  , not linked to the system  ie just
a loose file , no test function etc
