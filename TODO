new function mpn_divexact_byBm1of   generic and x86_64 versions done
done speed, tests , fat
not done try 

new functions divrem_euclidean_qr_1 asm and c (qr,r version)  
done try , fat
not done speed,tests

mpn_divrem_1 with qxn=0 now calls mpn_divrem_euclidean_qr_1 always
replace all internel calls to mpn_divrem_1 with the new euclidean
we could replace mpn_mod_1   as well   !!!

yasm'ify addmul_2.asm 
and remove x86_defs , why did I think I could delete this , its needed for
fat
