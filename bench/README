The idea is to have a hierarchy of benchmarks, with benchmark results
computed for the entire "MPIRbench", and for "MPIRbench.app.mersenne",
"MPIRbench.app.RSA", "MPIRbench.app.RSA.encrypt", etc, separately.

For MPIRbench 0.1, there are just three parts:

    [Multiply large numbers]
    base.multiply   128
                    512
                    8192
                    131072
                    2097152

    [Divide numbers of different sizes by small primes]
    base.divide     8192/32         preinv
                    8192/64         preinv
                    8192/128
                    8192/4096
                    8192/8064       clever
                    131072/8192     barrett repeat
                    131072/65536
                    8388608/4194304 newton+barrett

    [Run the RSA encryption algorithm]
    app.RSA     encrypt/verify  512
                    1024
                    2048
                decrypt/sign    512
                    1024
                    2048

Result scores are computed as a geometric mean.  Please use the included
script runbench for running the benchmarks and computing benchmark scores.

When reporting results please include:

     A. Machine type and model
     B. CPU type and clock frequency
     C. MPIR version used
     D. Modifications as permitted above
     E. Compiler and compiler version used
     F. Compiler options used

Please also report any changes you have made to MPIR or the benchmark code
provided here.
